# RememberBreakDownItem

This mod for The Long Dark remembers the tool you last used to break down some object.
Thus, when breaking down multiple objects of the same type (curtains, branches, crates, etc.) you don't need to
keep switching from an axe or knife to 'no tool' again and again.

In the break down tool selection panel, it also enables the use of the A and D keys to switch between tools
and the space bar to start breaking down the item.
